    would be nice to 

		Type-centric design
		Only the code it needs to render
		Happens to look good printed out
		Visual elements do not compete with each-other for space
		Look in Flatly and TeX to see what special cases have classes i.e. figures, quotes, tables, asides and see what classes I have available in bootstrap for the same
		All core post types should be responsive designs



		Add:
		  good font
		  Butternick rules
		  Tufte aside type?
		  make images responsive
			take away numbering of posts
			put twitter in twitter handle area
			make articles into pages and link it to a list of actual pages
			remove lozenges from footer and pagination
			make photosets resizeable: http://stylehatch.github.io/photoset-grid/
			
Todo
	Use less
	Do more css
 		Eliminate:
		  rounded corners
		  gradients
		  adjacent-near-density borders
		  make hover highlighting more obvious like T&B do
		  eliminate all the grey boxes and large blocks of color
		  eliminate all the extraneous colors on the navbar and
		  link hover coloring
	
	Include more tumblr features
		+Basic Variables
  	  +add link glyph to show where a link is rather than an underline or some other technique
		~Navigation
		  +pagination buttons
		  +ask page

Stuff that could be cool for later
  tags as classes
  post type as text to use as css, but not that useful because I already can just put it inside the tumblr tags
  read more breaks for longer prose pieces
